### Brain, Breast, Chest Imaging
1. 4D fMRI motion correction and reconstruction.  
2. Breast cancer detection from digital mammograms using transformers.  
3. Large-scale chest X-ray classification with long-tailed imbalance techniques.

### Neuromorphic Vision
1. Real-time asynchronous event clustering and star tracking on resource-limited hardware.  
2. Human activity and gesture recognition from event-based data.

### Robotics
1. YOLOv7-tiny object detection pipelines in ROS2 for underwater autonomous systems.

### Large Language Models
1. Hierarchical task decomposition, reward synthesis, and refinement for humanoid self-evolvement.  
2. VLM reasoning using agentic tools, unified models, and latent-space representations.
3. Fine tuning of LLMs and VLMs on task specific datasets.

### Autonomous Driving
1. CNN–Transformer hybrid backbone for multimodal RGB + LiDAR feature extraction.  
2. Integrated Feature Pyramid Networks for improved multi-scale representation.
 
### Efficient Inference & Quantization
1. Integer-only 8-bit (quantized) and 2-bit (ternarized) CNN/SSM pipelines for embedded and edge deployment.
